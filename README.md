## Description:

- It is designed to practice basic Backend concepts with Node JS and SQL.
- Node JS is used to create static server, create communication with the database through endpoints (read, save, delete notes).
- SQL is used to create the database where the notes written in the app will be saved. At the moment you can only add title and description.
- React is used to create application functions with events (API requests to paint previously saved notes, save notes, delete notes, save form input values...).
